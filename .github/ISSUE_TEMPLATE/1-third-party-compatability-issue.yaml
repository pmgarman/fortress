        **Support Scope:** 
        
        Unless otherwise specified on your invoice/plan, we don't guarantee troubleshooting support for any issues related
        to any third party themes and plugins that you install in combination with Fortress.
        In almost all cases, issues are caused by poorly coded plugins/themes. 
        
        However, if you are able to pinpoint the issue to a specific plugin/theme (setting) we'll usually be able to help you out
        and provide you an idea on how to move forward:
        
        - If there an issue in Fortress's codebase that causes other plugins to error, we'll fix it ASAP. (This is very rare)
        - Provide you guidelines on what the third-party software needs to fix in their code.
        - Potentially, provide you a code snippet to fix the third-party software.
        
        If you are able to reproduce the issue without ANY third party plugins and themes, open a [`Fortress Bug`](https://github.com/snicco/fortress/issues/new/choose) instead.
        
        We need your assistance to help you as fast as possible. The more information you provide, the quicker we can resolve your issue.
        
        Invalid/Incomplete issues can not be processed. If you don't know how to provide the required information, ask the community for [`Troubleshooting Help`](https://github.com/snicco/issue-templates-test/discussions/new?category=troubleshooting-help).
      
        Please try to give your issue a good title:
        - ‚úÖ Ajax login form of Acme plugin crashes with Fortress 2FA enabled.
        - ‚ùå I can't log in anymore.

        We need to know which third party software component(s) make this issue surface. If you can pinpoint the exact plugin settings, even better.<br>
        
        1. Disable all plugins and verify that the functionality works with just Fortress active.
            1.1 If the functionality does not work, it's likely an issue in your Theme.
        2. Activate the next plugin.
        3. Verify if the functionality still works.
        4. As soon as the the functionality breaks:
            4.1 Remember the plugin.
            4.2 Disable **all** plugins again.
            4.3 Enable **only** the "remembered plugin".
            4.4 Does the issue still happen? => You found the root cause.
        5. Repeat at step 2 until the functionality breaks.
